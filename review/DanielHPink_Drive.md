# Book Review Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us (Daniel H. Pink)

I got the recommendation to the book half a year ago and watched the [summary video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc&t=14s) on youtube. It's a great 10 minute summary and visualization of the book. But nevertheless I wanted to read it.

The book is devided in two parts:
- New Operating Model
- The Three Elements

In "New Operating Model" Daniel H. Pink describe the shift from the work we've done in the past to the work we're doing now - from rule-based routine tasks to non-routine conceptual task. For the former, the "carrot-and-sticks" principle with the "if-then" rewards had worked. But this is not true anymore. For the Latter, the non-routine conceptual tasks motivation works different. And as motivation is working in a different way, we need to think about a new "operating model" for our society. Moving from Motivation 1.0 (Surviving) to Motivation 2.0 (external rewards and punishment) to Motivation 3.0.
He also describes that there're two types of people:
- Type X behavior fueled by extrinsic desires and rewards
- Type I behavior concerns itself more with the inherent satisfaction of the activity itself

While Motivation 2.0 worked quite good for Type X, we need a Motivation 3.0 for Type I.

In part 2 he diggs deeper on the "The Three Elements":
- Autonomy
- Mastery
- Purpose

Our "default setting" is to be __autonomous__ and self-directed. That's the inner drive we have in us. Therefore providing an environment where we can work autonomous motivates us.
While Motivation 2.0 required compliance, Motivation 3.0 demands engagement, and only engagement can produce __Mastery__. The pursuit of Mastery is an important part of Motivation 3.0. One important element of Mastery is the Flow and working in it.
Humans, by their nature, seek for __purpose__. We want to make a contribution and be a part of something important than just for ourself. In Motivation 3.0, Purpose Maximization is taking its place alongside profit maximization as an aspiration and a guiding principle. The transition of a company from only profit maximization towards accompanying both, profit and purpose maximization could remake our world.
